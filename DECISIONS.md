# Project Decisions Log

This document records significant architectural and technical decisions made during the development of the School Management System.

## 2025-06-26: Initial Project Setup

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.0.3 with TypeScript
  - Chosen for its excellent developer experience, server-side rendering capabilities, and strong TypeScript support.
  - Provides built-in routing and API routes.

- **Backend**: NestJS 10.x with TypeScript
  - Provides a modular architecture with built-in support for REST APIs.
  - Includes excellent TypeScript support and dependency injection.
  - Integrates well with TypeORM for database operations.

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14
  - Chosen for its reliability, performance, and advanced features.
  - Good support for complex queries and relationships.

### Development Environment
- **Containerization**: Docker with Docker Compose
  - Ensures consistent development environments across the team.
  - Simplifies dependency management and deployment.
  - Includes separate services for frontend, backend, database, and pgAdmin.

### Security
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
  - Secure stateless authentication for API endpoints.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented.

- **Environment Variables**
  - Sensitive configuration stored in .env files (gitignored).
  - Example files (.env.example) provided for reference.
  - Environment validation in both frontend and backend.

### API Design
- **RESTful API**
  - Resource-based endpoints.
  - Consistent response formats.
  - Comprehensive error handling.
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
  - Auto-generated API documentation.
  - Available at `/api-docs` when backend is running.

### Database Management
- **Migrations**: TypeORM migrations
  - Version-controlled database schema changes.
  - Reproducible database state across environments.
- **Initial Data**: SQL scripts in `init-db` directory
  - Sets up initial database schema and seed data.
  - Runs automatically on container startup.

### Development Workflow
- **Code Quality**
  - ESLint for code linting.
  - Prettier for code formatting.
  - Git hooks for pre-commit checks.
- **Testing**
  - Jest for unit and integration tests.
  - Supertest for API testing.

## Future Considerations
- [ ] Add end-to-end testing with Cypress
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging
- [ ] Consider implementing GraphQL for more flexible data fetching
