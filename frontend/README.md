# Frontend Application (Vite + React + TypeScript)

This project is a modern frontend application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Getting Started

To get the development server running:

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified in `vite.config.ts`) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the application by modifying files in the `src/` directory. The main application entry point is `src/main.tsx`, and routes are defined in `src/router.tsx`. Page components are primarily located in the `pages/` directory. The application will auto-update in the browser as you edit the files.

## Available Scripts

In the `frontend` directory, you can run the following scripts:

*   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode with hot-reloading.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
*   `npm run start`: Serves the production build locally for preview (use `vite preview`).
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
